# IW6x: Client

![iw4x](src/client/resources/logo.bmp?raw=true)

## Download

- **[Click here to download the latest build](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/XLabsProject/iw6x-client/artifacts/build%2Fbin%2Fx64%2FRelease%2Fiw6x.exe?branch=master&job=Environment%3A%20APPVEYOR_BUILD_WORKER_IMAGE%3DVisual%20Studio%202019%2C%20PREMAKE_ACTION%3Dvs2019%3B%20Configuration%3A%20Release)**
- **You will need to drop this in your Call of Duty: Ghosts installation folder. If you don't have Call of Duty: Ghosts, get those game files first.**
- The client is still in an early alpha stage. It is far from being usable and will have bugs!

## How to compile

- Clone the Git repo. Do NOT download it as ZIP, that won't work.
- Update the submodules and run `premake5 vs2019` or simply use the delivered `generate.bat`.
- Build via solution file in `build\iw6x.sln`.

## Premake arguments

| Argument                    | Description                                    |
|:----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|
| `--copy-to=PATH`            | Optional, copy the EXE to a custom folder after build, define the path here if wanted. |
| `--dev-build`               | Enable development builds of the client. |
